# Long-Term Dynamics of Institutions: Using ABM as a Complementary Tool to Support Theory Development in Historical Studies

制度的长期动态:使用ABM作为支持历史研究理论发展的补充工具

## Abstract

Historical data are valuable resources for providing insights into social patterns in the past. However, these data often inform us at the macro-level of analysis but not about the role of individuals’ behaviours in the emergence of long-term patterns. Therefore, it is difficult to infer ‘how’ and ‘why’ certain patterns emerged in the past. Historians use various methods to draw hypotheses about the underlying reasons for emerging patterns and trends, but since the patterns are the results of hundreds if not thousands of years of human behaviour, these hypotheses can never be tested in reality. Our proposition is that simulation models and specifically, agent-based models (ABMs) can be used as complementary tools in historical studies to support hypothesis building. The approach that we propose and test in this paper is to design and configure models in such a way as to generate historical patterns, consequently aiming to find individual-level explanations for the emerging pattern. In this work, we use an existing, empirically validated, agent-based model of common pool resource management to test hypotheses formulated based on a historical dataset. We first investigate whether the model can replicate various patterns observed in the dataset, and second, whether it can contribute to a better understanding of the underlying mechanism that led to the observed empirical trends. We showcase how ABM can be used as a complementary tool to support theory development in historical studies. Finally, we provide some guidelines for using ABM as a tool to test historical hypotheses.

历史数据是提供过去社会模式洞见的宝贵资源。然而,这些数据通常在宏观分析层面告知我们,但不告知我们个人行为在长期模式涌现中的作用。因此,很难推断某些模式在过去"如何"以及"为什么"会出现。历史学家使用各种方法对涌现模式和趋势的潜在原因提出假设,但由于这些模式是数百年甚至数千年人类行为的结果,这些假设永远无法在现实中得到检验。我们的主张是,模拟模型,特别是主体模型(ABMs)可以在历史研究中用作支持假设构建的补充工具。我们在本文中提出并测试的方法是以这样一种方式设计和配置模型,以生成历史模式,从而旨在为涌现模式找到个体层面的解释。在这项工作中,我们使用一个现有的、经验验证的共同池资源管理主体模型来检验基于历史数据集制定的假设。我们首先研究模型是否可以复制数据集中观察到的各种模式,其次,它是否可以有助于更好地理解导致观察到的经验趋势的潜在机制。我们展示了ABM如何被用作支持历史研究理论发展的补充工具。最后,我们提供了一些使用ABM作为检验历史假设工具的指导原则。
