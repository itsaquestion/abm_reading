# Polarization on Social Media: Micro-Level Evidence and Macro-Level Implications

社交媒体上的两极分化:微观层面的证据和宏观层面的启示

## Abstract

We formally introduce and empirically test alternative micro-foundations of social influence in the context of communication on social media. To this end, we first propose a general theoretical framework allowing us to represent by different combinations of model parameters of influence-response functions whether and to what extent exposure to online content leads to assimilative or repulsive (distancing) influence on a user's opinion. We show by means of an agent-based model of opinion dynamics on social media that these influence-response functions indeed generate competing predictions about whether personalization (defined as the extent to which users are shielded from foreign opinions) increases or decreases polarization. Next, we conducted an online experiment with respondents recruited on Facebook to estimate model parameters empirically, using Bayesian models for censored data. In the experiment, participants´ opinions were measured before and after exposure to arguments reflecting different ideological positions and moral foundations in a within-subject design. Our findings support that exposure to foreign opinions leads to assimilation towards those opinions, moderated by the extent of (perceived) ideological similarity to the source of influence. We also find weak evidence in support of repulsion (distancing), but only for very large disagreement. Feeding estimated parameter values back into the agent-based model suggests that reducing personalization would not increase, but instead reduce the level of polarization generated by the opinion dynamics of the model. We conclude that the naive interpolation of micro-processes to macro-predictions can be misleading if models are not sufficiently empirically calibrated.


我们在社交媒体传播的背景下,正式引入并实证检验了社会影响的替代微观基础。为此,我们首先提出了一个一般性的理论框架,允许我们通过影响-反应函数的不同模型参数组合来表示在线内容的接触是否以及在多大程度上导致了用户观点的同化或排斥(疏远)影响。我们通过一个社交媒体观点动力学的主体模型表明,这些影响-反应函数确实产生了关于个性化(定义为用户受到外来观点屏蔽的程度)是增加还是减少两极分化的相互竞争的预测。接下来,我们在Facebook上招募受访者进行了一项在线实验,使用针对删失数据的贝叶斯模型对模型参数进行实证估计。在实验中,我们在受访者接触反映不同意识形态立场和道德基础的论点之前和之后,在一个被试内设计中测量了他们的观点。我们的发现支持,接触外来观点会导致向这些观点的同化,这一过程受到与影响来源的(感知)意识形态相似性程度的调节。我们也发现了支持排斥(疏远)的弱证据,但只针对非常大的分歧。将估计的参数值反馈到主体模型中表明,减少个性化不会增加,而是会降低模型的观点动力学所产生的两极分化水平。我们得出结论,如果模型没有得到足够的经验校准,将微观过程朴素地推断到宏观预测可能会产生误导。


# Raising the Spectrum of Polarization: Generating Issue Alignment with a Weighted Balance Opinion Dynamics Model 

提高两极分化的谱系:用加权平衡观点动力学模型生成议题结盟

## Abstract

Political polarization is often understood in terms of extreme issue positions. But polarization can only emerge if issue positions are aligned into a single ideological spectrum, ranging from left/ liberal to right/conservative. It is unclear how a high-dimensional space of policy issues can organize itself into a single ideological spectrum and give rise to polarization. We explain this phenomenon using Weighted Balance Theory (WBT), which describes the interaction of issue positions and interpersonal affect. By implementing WBT into an agent-based opinion dynamics model, we generate a single ideological spectrum from an arbitrarily high dimensional issue space. Furthermore, we show that WBT outperforms other models in predicting respondents’ attitudes in 44 years worth of empirical data from the ANES survey. A calibrated version of our model can reproduce properties of empirically observed opinion distributions.

政治两极分化通常从极端的议题立场来理解。但是,只有当议题立场结盟成一个单一的意识形态光谱,从左/自由到右/保守,两极分化才会出现。目前尚不清楚高维度的政策议题空间如何组织成一个单一的意识形态光谱并导致两极分化。我们使用加权平衡理论(WBT)来解释这一现象,该理论描述了议题立场和人际影响之间的相互作用。通过将WBT实现到一个基于主体的观点动力学模型中,我们从一个任意高维的议题空间生成一个单一的意识形态光谱。此外,我们表明,在预测来自ANES调查的44年的经验数据中的受访者态度方面,WBT优于其他模型。我们模型的校准版本可以再现经验观察到的观点分布的属性。


# Validating Argument-Based Opinion Dynamics with Survey Experiments 

用调查实验验证基于论证的观点动力学模型

## Abstract
The empirical validation of models remains one of the most important challenges in opinion dynamics. In this contribution, we report on recent developments on combining data from a survey experiment with an argument-based computational model of opinion formation in which biased processing is the principle mechanism. We first review the development of argument-based models, and extend a model with confirmation bias by noise mimicking an external source of balanced information. We then study the behavior of this extended model to characterize the macroscopic opinion distributions that emerge from the process. A new method for the automated classification of model outcomes is presented. In the final part of the paper, we describe and apply a multi-level validation approach using the micro and the macro data gathered in the survey experiment. We revisit previous results on the micro-level calibration using data on argument-induced opinion change, and show that the extended model matches surveyed opinion distributions in a specific region in the parameter space. The estimated strength of biased processing given the macro data is highly compatible with those values that achieve high likelihood at the micro level. The model provides a solid bridge from the micro processes of individual attitude change to macro level opinion distributions.

模型的经验验证仍然是观点动力学中最重要的挑战之一。在本文中,我们报告了最近将调查实验数据与基于论证的观点形成计算模型相结合的进展,其中有偏处理是主要机制。我们首先回顾了基于论证模型的发展,并通过模拟平衡信息外部来源的噪声来扩展一个具有确认偏差的模型。然后,我们研究了这个扩展模型的行为,以表征从过程中涌现出的宏观观点分布。提出了一种用于模型结果自动分类的新方法。在论文的最后部分,我们描述并应用了一种多层次验证方法,使用调查实验中收集的微观和宏观数据。我们重新审视了之前关于使用论证引起的观点变化数据进行微观层次校准的结果,并表明扩展模型在参数空间的特定区域内与调查的观点分布相匹配。给定宏观数据,估计的有偏处理强度与在微观层次上实现高似然的值高度兼容。该模型在个人态度变化的微观过程与宏观层次观点分布之间提供了一个坚实的桥梁。

# Schwartz Human Values and the Economic Performance
施瓦茨人类价值观与经济表现

## Abstract
In the literature, human values are defined as desirable, trans-situational goals serving as guiding principles in people's lives. Schwartz introduced the concept of ten different values that are grouped into four higher order values: openness to change, conservation, self-transcendence, and self-enhancement. Some of the Schwartz values will underlie acting for one's own good, the others for the good of the community. The collective output of the community will depend on these two types of actions and the relations between them. Acting for the benefit of others may, yet does not have to, increase the total benefit for the community, even when it leads to less benefit to the self. In this paper we provide an analogy for the mechanisms underlying the relation between Schwartz values and economic output. The observed economic output is a result of the behaviour of many heterogeneous agents interacting with each other. The main problem is to verify whether and how the differences in the distributions of Schwartz values in a given community may influence its collective economic output. We classify Schwartz values into two different groups, based on the different effects these values may have on the observed collective output. A higher importance of self-enhancement (power, achievement, and hedonism) and conservation (security, tradition, and conformity) increases working time in the public sector and the public goods return, while simultaneously lowering working time in the private sector and the private goods return. The values of openness to change (stimulation and self-direction) and self-transcendence (universalism and benevolence) have the opposite effect.

在文献中,人类价值观被定义为理想的、跨情境的目标,作为人们生活中的指导原则。施瓦茨引入了十种不同的价值观概念,它们被分为四个更高阶的价值观:开放变革、保守、自我超越和自我提升。施瓦茨的一些价值观将促使个人为自己的利益行事,其他则为社区的利益行事。社区的集体产出将取决于这两种类型的行为及其之间的关系。为他人的利益行事可能会,但不一定会增加社区的总利益,即使它导致自身利益减少。在本文中,我们提供了一个类比,说明施瓦茨价值观与经济产出之间关系的潜在机制。观察到的经济产出是许多相互作用的异质主体行为的结果。主要问题是验证给定社区中施瓦茨价值观分布的差异是否以及如何影响其集体经济产出。我们根据施瓦茨价值观可能对观察到的集体产出产生的不同影响,将其分为两组。自我提升(权力、成就和享乐主义)和保守(安全、传统和遵从)的重要性提高,会增加公共部门的工作时间和公共物品回报,同时降低私营部门的工作时间和私人物品回报。开放变革(刺激和自我导向)和自我超越(普遍主义和仁慈)的价值观具有相反的效果。


# Modelling Value Change: An Exploratory Approach

建模价值变革:一种探索性方法

## Abstract

Value and moral change have increasingly become topics of interest in the philosophical literature. Several theoretical accounts have been proposed. These are usually based on certain theoretical and conceptual assumptions. Their strengths and weaknesses are often difficult to determine and compare because they are based on limited empirical evidence. We propose agent-based modeling to build simulation models that can theoretically help us explore accounts of value change. We can investigate whether a simulation model based on a specific account of value change can reproduce relevant phenomena. To illustrate this approach, we build a model based on the pragmatist account of value change proposed by Van De Poel and Kudina (2022). We show that this model can reproduce four relevant phenomena, namely 1) the inevitability and stability of values, 2) societies differ in openness and resistance to change, 3) moral revolutions, and 4) lock-in. This makes this account promising, although more research is needed to see how well it can explain other relevant phenomena and compare its strengths and weaknesses to other accounts. On a more methodological level, our contribution suggests that simulation models might be useful to theoretically explore accounts of value change and make further progress in this area.

价值和道德变革已经越来越多地成为哲学文献中的兴趣主题。已经提出了几种理论解释。这些通常基于某些理论和概念假设。它们的优缺点通常难以确定和比较,因为它们基于有限的经验证据。我们建议使用基于主体的建模来构建可以在理论上帮助我们探索价值变革解释的仿真模型。我们可以研究基于特定价值变革解释的仿真模型是否可以再现相关现象。为了说明这种方法,我们构建了一个基于Van De Poel和Kudina (2022) 提出的实用主义价值变革解释的模型。我们表明,这个模型可以再现四个相关现象,即1)价值观的不可避免性和稳定性,2)社会在开放性和变革阻力方面的差异,3)道德革命,以及4)锁定。这使得这种解释很有前景,尽管需要更多研究来看它能在多大程度上解释其他相关现象,并将其优缺点与其他解释进行比较。在更多方法论层面上,我们的贡献表明,仿真模型可能有助于理论上探索价值变革的解释,并在这一领域取得进一步进展。


# Identifying Personal and Social Drivers of Dietary Patterns: An Agent-Based Model of Dutch Consumer Behavior

识别饮食模式的个人和社会驱动因素:荷兰消费者行为的主体模型

## Abstract

Understanding the drivers of dietary decisions is crucial for encouraging and facilitating environmentally sustainable consumption patterns. Previous work has focused on the utility that consumers place on factors such as price, quality, and ethics when making dietary decisions, or on the effects of personal values and peer influence on consumption of individual products. However, less attention has been paid to the interacting roles of values, perceptions, and social networks in dietary decision-making, and how these relate to mismatches between values and diet choice. Here, we develop an agent-based model of individual consumers making choices between five possible diets: omnivore, flexitarian, pescatarian, vegetarian, or vegan. Each consumer makes decisions based on personal constraints and values, and their perceptions of how well each diet matches with those values. Consumers can also be influenced by each other’s perceptions via interaction across three social networks: household members, friends, and acquaintances. We show that consumers primarily make decisions based on cost and taste, even when they value ethics and health, and illustrate three potential causes of the ‘attitude-behavior gap’ between ethical motivations and diet choice. This highlights the potential for both policy-driven changes to pricing structures, and increased awareness around sustainability and health attributes of different diets, in overcoming constraints and misperceptions to facilitate transitions to sustainable diets.

了解饮食决策的驱动因素对于鼓励和促进环境可持续消费模式至关重要。以前的工作主要关注消费者在做出饮食决策时对价格、质量和道德等因素的效用,或个人价值观和同伴影响对单个产品消费的影响。然而,在饮食决策中,价值观、认知和社交网络的相互作用,以及这些因素如何与价值观和饮食选择之间的不匹配相关联,却受到较少关注。在这里,我们开发了一个关于个人消费者在五种可能的饮食之间做出选择的主体模型:杂食、弹性素食、鱼素食、素食或纯素食。每个消费者根据个人约束和价值观以及他们对每种饮食与这些价值观匹配程度的认知来做出决策。消费者也可以通过三个社交网络(家庭成员、朋友和熟人)的互动而相互影响对方的认知。我们表明,即使消费者重视道德和健康,他们也主要根据成本和口味做出决定,并说明了道德动机和饮食选择之间"态度-行为差距"的三个潜在原因。这突出了政策驱动的定价结构变化以及提高对不同饮食的可持续性和健康属性的认识在克服约束和错误认知以促进向可持续饮食转变方面的潜力。




# Modelling Adaptive and Anticipatory Human Decision-Making in Complex Human-Environment Systems

在复杂的人-环境系统中建模人类适应性和预期性决策

## Abstract
To effectively manage complex human-environment fisheries systems, it is necessary to understand the psychology of fisher agents. While bio-economic models typically provide simple, abstract approaches for human behaviour (e.g. fully informed profit maximisers), fisher agents are of course neither simple nor perfect. Imperfections of learning, memory, and information availability, combined with the diversity of value preferences within populations, can lead to substantial deviations and unanticipated effects of interventions. This paper presents a computational model of fisher agents’ decision-making that draws on theoretical and empirical psychological insights to enrich this critical component. The model includes mechanisms for information integration (learning), social comparisons, and thresholds for economic satisfaction. In offering this enriched account, the model captures how fishers may adapt behaviourally given changes in policy, economic conditions, or social pressures. Furthermore, the model can be parameterised to capture the effects of different socio-cultural contexts can be simulated. The model of fisher agents has been implemented as part of POSEIDON (an agent-based fisheries management model), showing that fishers imbued with the model learn and adapt when responding dynamically to changing conditions. The model is thus demonstrated in a fisheries environment, but we discuss how its architecture could be implemented for simulation in other human-environment systems, such as designing policies to combat the human-environment problems.

为了有效管理复杂的人-环境渔业系统,有必要了解渔民主体的心理。虽然生物经济模型通常为人类行为提供简单、抽象的方法(例如完全知情的利润最大化者),但渔民主体当然既不简单也不完美。学习、记忆和信息可用性的不完善,加上人口内部价值偏好的多样性,可能导致干预措施产生实质性偏差和意料之外的影响。本文提出了一个渔民主体决策的计算模型,该模型借鉴理论和实证心理学见解来丰富这一关键组成部分。该模型包括信息整合(学习)、社会比较和经济满意度阈值的机制。在提供这种丰富的解释时,该模型捕捉了渔民如何在政策、经济条件或社会压力发生变化时在行为上进行适应。此外,该模型可以参数化以捕捉不同社会文化背景的影响。渔民主体模型已作为POSEIDON(一个基于主体的渔业管理模型)的一部分实现,表明赋予该模型的渔民在动态响应不断变化的条件时学习和适应。因此,该模型在渔业环境中得到了演示,但我们讨论了如何在其他人-环境系统的仿真中实现其架构,例如设计政策以应对人-环境问题。


# Examining the Interplay Between National Strategies and Value Change in the Battle Against COVID-19: An Agent-Based Modelling Inquiry

## Abstract

Social disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic challenged existing institutional arrangements that govern the society. During that time, nation-states had to prevent the collapse of society and rapidly establish new institutions and adapt existing ones to address public health, job security, and freedom-of-movement concerns. At the same time, institutional developments are explicitly or implicitly related to the cultural and moral values relevant to societal well-being. Values hold a significant role in governing society during crises, guiding states' institutional response to unforeseen challenges. However, values themselves are not static: research has shown that values may change rapidly during crises. This paper studies the relationship between value change and institutional change in times of crisis using agent-based modelling and machine learning techniques. In our model, we represent countries as agents who define institutional strategies to control disease spread and subsequently protect the well-being of their citizens. Institutional change and value change are modelled as two independent processes. Yet, the model confirms the seemingly trivial inverse correlation between them: when the value of openness-to-change increases in a society, the institutional strategies also become less strict. Conversely, when conservatism increases, the strategies become stricter on average. However, there is no direct causal relationship between the two changes: being open to change does not necessarily make a government select more relaxed rules, but this correlation is rather an emergent consequence of being more flexible in changing rules, whether the new ones are stricter or more relaxed.

COVID-19大流行造成的社会混乱挑战了管理社会的现有制度安排。在那段时间里,民族国家必须防止社会崩溃,迅速建立新的制度,并调整现有制度以解决公共卫生、就业保障和行动自由等问题。同时,制度发展与社会福祉相关的文化和道德价值观有着明确或隐含的联系。在危机时期,价值观在管理社会方面发挥着重要作用,指导国家应对不可预见挑战的制度响应。然而,价值观本身并非一成不变:研究表明,在危机期间,价值观可能会迅速变化。本文使用基于主体的建模和机器学习技术,研究了危机时期价值变革与制度变革之间的关系。在我们的模型中,我们将国家表示为主体,它们定义制度策略以控制疾病传播,并随后保护公民的福祉。制度变革和价值变革被建模为两个独立的过程。然而,该模型证实了它们之间看似平凡的反向相关性:当一个社会的开放性价值增加时,制度策略也会变得不那么严格。相反,当保守主义增加时,策略平均会变得更加严格。然而,这两种变化之间没有直接的因果关系:开放变革并不一定会让政府选择更宽松的规则,而这种相关性更多是在改变规则时更加灵活的一个涌现结果,无论新规则是更严格还是更宽松。



# The Role of Values in Pandemic Management: An Agent-Based Model

## Abstract

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has made abundantly evident that human behavior is a critical factor in determining whether interventions intended to manage infection spread are effective. Human behavior is driven by decision processes about whether to comply with advice from public-health experts and instructions from officials charged with managing pandemic response within organizations and governmental regions. And guiding those decisions are personal values, often shared with others, which are understudied features of pandemic management. Here, we demonstrate the role of values in a pandemic simulation using The Artificial Organization (TAO), an existing, strongly validated, agent-based, decision-support tool for pandemic management. We enhance TAO by adding human values to create TAO-V, focusing particularly on values related to political ideology, the spread of those values, and the way political values and compliance decisions have interacted in the United States of America (and other nations, usually to a lesser extent). TAO-V confirms that human values are influential factors in a pandemic simulation, which invites testing against real-world data from pandemic-management efforts (we pursue this in a subsequent paper). Even before real-world testing, the results of this study suggest that public-health messaging might be more effective if it were to engage values rather than only stress compliance with public-health recommendations.

SARS-CoV-2大流行已经充分表明,人类行为是决定旨在管理感染传播的干预措施是否有效的关键因素。人类行为是由决策过程驱动的,即是否遵从公共卫生专家的建议以及负责管理组织和政府区域内疫情响应的官员的指示。而指导这些决策的是个人价值观,这些价值观通常与他人共享,是疫情管理中研究不足的特征。在这里,我们使用人工组织(TAO)演示了价值观在疫情模拟中的作用,TAO是一个现有的、经过强有力验证的、基于主体的疫情管理决策支持工具。我们通过添加人类价值观来增强TAO,创建TAO-V,特别关注与政治意识形态相关的价值观、这些价值观的传播,以及政治价值观和合规决策在美国(和其他国家,通常程度较低)的互动方式。 TAO-V证实,人类价值观是疫情模拟中的重要影响因素,这邀请对疫情管理努力的真实世界数据进行测试(我们在后续论文中进行了这一点)。即使在进行真实世界测试之前,本研究的结果也表明,如果公共卫生信息能够引入价值观,而不仅仅强调遵守公共卫生建议,它可能会更有效。



# Can a Single Line of Code Change Society? Optimizing Engagement in Recommender Systems Necessarily Entails Systemic Risks for Global Information Flows, Opinion Dynamics and Social Structures

## Abstract

As the last few years have seen an increase in both online hostility and polarization, we need to move beyond the fact-checking reflex or the praise for better moderation on social networking sites (SNS) and investigate their impact on social structures and social cohesion. In particular, the role of recommender systems deployed by Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) such as Facebook or Twitter has been overlooked. This paper draws on the literature on cognitive science, digital media, and opinion dynamics to propose a faithful replica of the entanglement between recommender systems, opinion dynamics and users' cognitive bias on SNSs like Twitter that is calibrated over a large scale longitudinal database of tweets from political activists. This model makes it possible to compare the consequences of various recommendation algorithms on the social fabric, to quantify their interaction with some major cognitive bias. In particular, we demonstrate that the recommender systems that seek to solely maximize users' engagement necessarily lead to a polarization of the opinion landscape, to a concentration of social power in the hands of the most toxic users and to an overexposure of users to negative content (up to 300% for some of them), a phenomenon called algorithmic negativity bias. Toxic users are more than twice as numerous in the top 1% of the most influential users than in the overall population. Overall, our results highlight the systemic risks generated by certain implementations of recommender systems and the urgent need to comprehensively identify implementations of recommender systems harmful to individuals and society. This is a necessary step in setting up future regulations for systemic SNSs, such as the European Digital Services Act.

随着近几年网上敌意和两极分化的加剧,我们需要超越事实核查的反射或对社交网站(SNS)更好审查的赞扬,研究它们对社会结构和社会凝聚力的影响。特别是,Facebook或Twitter等超大型在线平台(VLOPs)部署的推荐系统的作用被忽视了。本文借鉴认知科学、数字媒体和观点动态的文献,提出了一个忠实的模型,复制了SNSs(如Twitter)上推荐系统、观点动态和用户认知偏差之间的纠缠,该模型是在政治活动家的大规模纵向推文数据库上校准的。该模型可以比较各种推荐算法对社会结构的影响,量化它们与一些主要认知偏差的交互作用。特别是,我们证明了仅寻求最大化用户参与度的推荐系统必然导致观点景观的两极分化,社会权力集中在最有毒用户的手中,以及用户过度暴露于负面内容(对某些用户高达300%),这种现象被称为算法负面偏差。在排名前1%的最有影响力用户中,有毒用户的数量是总人口的两倍多。总的来说,我们的结果突出了某些推荐系统实现所产生的系统性风险,以及全面识别对个人和社会有害的推荐系统实现的迫切需要。这是为系统性SNSs(如欧洲数字服务法案)建立未来监管的必要步骤。




# The Epistemic Role of Diversity in Juries: An Agent-Based Model

多样性在陪审团中的认知作用:一个主体模型

## Abstract
Many factors contribute to whether juries reach right verdicts. Here we focus on the role of diversity. Direct empirical studies of the effect of altering factors in jury deliberation are severely limited for conceptual, practical, and ethical reasons. Using an agent-based model to avoid these difficulties, we argue that diversity can play at least four importantly different roles in affecting jury verdicts. We show that where different subgroups have access to different information, equal representation can strengthen epistemic jury success, and if one subgroup has access to particularly strong evidence, epistemic success may demand participation by that group. Diversity can also reduce the redundancy of the information on which a jury focuses, which can have a positive impact. Finally, and most surprisingly, we show that limiting communication between diverse groups in juries can favor epistemic success as well.

许多因素影响陪审团是否能做出正确的判决。这里我们关注多样性的作用。由于概念、实践和道德上的原因,直接实证研究改变陪审团审议因素的效果受到严重限制。为了避免这些困难,我们使用一个主体模型,认为多样性可以通过至少四种重要的不同方式影响陪审团的判决。我们表明,当不同的亚群体可以获得不同的信息时,平等代表可以加强陪审团的认知成功;如果一个亚群体可以获得特别有力的证据,认知成功可能需要该群体的参与。多样性还可以减少陪审团关注的信息的冗余,这可能产生积极影响。最后,也是最令人惊讶的是,我们表明,限制陪审团中不同群体之间的交流也可以有利于认知成功。



# An Agent-Based Model of Cultural Change for a Low-Carbon Transition

## Takeaways

1. 低碳行为作为一种文化的传播。

## Abstract

Meeting climate goals requires radical changes in the consumption behaviour of individuals. This necessitates an understanding of how the diffusion of low-carbon behaviour will occur. The speed and interdependency of these changes in behavioural choices may be modulated by individuals’ culture. We develop an agent-based model to study how behavioural decarbonisation interacts with longer-term cultural change, composed of individuals with multiple behaviours that evolve due to imperfect social learning in a social network. Using the definition of culture as socially transmitted information, we represent individuals’ environmental identity as an aggregation of attitudes towards multiple relevant behaviours. The strength of interaction between individuals is determined by the similarity in their environmental identity, leading to inter-behavioural dependency and spillovers in green attitudes. Our results show that the initial distribution of agent attitudes towards behaviours and asymmetries in social learning, such as confirmation bias, are the main drivers of model dynamics, helping to generate awareness of what roadblocks may appear to deep decarbonisation. To assess the impact of culture beyond a purely diffusive regime, we introduce green influencers as a minority of individuals who broadcast a green attitude. The greatest emissions reduction is achieved with the inclusion of culture, relative to a behavioural independence case, and with low confirmation bias. However, green influencers fail to achieve deep behavioural decarbonisation through solely voluntary action. We identify areas for further research regarding how culture, through inter-behavioural dependence, may be leveraged for climate policy.

实现气候目标需要个人消费行为发生根本性变化。这需要理解低碳行为的扩散将如何发生。这些行为选择变化的速度和相互依赖性可能受到个人文化的调节。我们开发了一个主体模型来研究行为脱碳如何与更长期的文化变迁相互作用,该模型由多个行为的个体组成,这些行为因在社交网络中不完全的社会学习而演变。使用文化作为社会传播信息的定义,我们将个人的环境认同表示为对多个相关行为态度的聚合。个体之间的互动强度取决于他们在环境认同上的相似性,导致绿色态度在行为之间的依赖和溢出。我们的结果表明,主体对行为的初始态度分布以及社会学习中的不对称性(如确认偏差)是模型动态的主要驱动因素,有助于提高对深度脱碳可能出现的障碍的认识。为了评估文化在纯粹扩散机制之外的影响,我们引入绿色影响者作为传播绿色态度的少数个体。与行为独立情况相比,在包含文化且确认偏差较低的情况下,实现了最大的排放减少。然而,仅通过自愿行动,绿色影响者无法实现深度行为脱碳。我们确定了进一步研究的领域,即如何通过行为间依赖性利用文化来制定气候政策。


# Methods That Support the Validation of Agent-Based Models: An Overview and Discussion

## Takeaways

1. 一个 Validation 的综述，后面再看。

## Abstract

Validation is the process of determining if a model adequately represents the system under study for the model’s intended purpose. Validation is a critical component in building the credibility of a simulation model with its end-users. Effectively conducting validation can be a daunting task for both novice and experienced simulation developers. Further compounding the difficult task of conducting validation is that there is no universally accepted approach for assessing a simulation. These challenges are particularly relevant to the paradigm of Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) because of the complexity found in these models’ mechanisms and in the real-world situations they attempt to represent. To aid both the novice and expert in conducting a validation process for an agent-based simulation, this article reviews nine methods that are useful for this process, including foundational topics of docking, empirical validation, sampling, and visualization, as well as advanced topics of bootstrapping, causal analysis, inverse generative social science, and role-playing. Each method is reviewed with respect to its benefits and limitations as a validation-supporting method for ABMS. Suggestions that may support a validation plan for an agent-based simulations, are also provided. This article is an introductory guide for understanding and conducting ABMS validation for developers of all experience levels.


验证是确定模型是否充分表示研究系统以满足模型预期目的的过程。验证是建立模拟模型对最终用户可信度的关键组成部分。无论是新手还是有经验的模拟开发人员,有效地进行验证都可能是一项艰巨的任务。进一步加剧验证任务难度的是,没有普遍接受的评估模拟的方法。这些挑战与主体建模和模拟(ABMS)范式尤其相关,因为这些模型的机制以及它们试图表示的现实世界情况都具有复杂性。为了帮助新手和专家为主体模拟进行验证过程,本文回顾了九种对该过程有用的方法,包括基础主题如对接、经验验证、抽样和可视化,以及高级主题如自助法、因果分析、反向生成社会科学和角色扮演。每种方法都根据其作为ABMS验证支持方法的优点和局限性进行了回顾。本文还提供了可能支持主体模拟验证计划的建议。本文是一份针对各种经验水平的开发人员理解和进行ABMS验证的入门指南。


# An Exploration of Drivers of Opinion Dynamics
探索观点动态的驱动因素

## Abstract
Our ability to deal with external changes is determined by our collective willingness to transform and adopt new technologies. These factors are driven by people's opinion on the change itself and the proposed policies. Humans constantly update their opinion by integrating new information they hear with their values, which helps them make a judgement about that new information. Here, we create an agent-based model that explicitly incorporates the concept of values to explore possible drivers of opinion dynamics. In the model, we explore several factors and perform local and global sensitivity analysis to test their individual and interaction effects. We find that consensus formation in the model is mainly determined by factors related to (1) the amount of stochasticity in the opinion updating procedure and (2) the relative ease with which old links are removed and new links are created. Our results demonstrate how opinions and values may co-evolve. Furthermore, they may help in understanding human responses to new policies such as covid-related restrictions or calls to shift to a more plant-based diet.

我们应对外部变化的能力取决于我们集体转型和采用新技术的意愿。这些因素受到人们对变革本身和提出的政策的看法的驱动。人们通过将他们听到的新信息与自己的价值观相结合来不断更新自己的观点,这有助于他们对新信息做出判断。在这里,我们创建了一个显式地结合价值观概念的主体模型,以探索观点动态的可能驱动因素。在模型中,我们探索了几个因素,并进行了局部和全局敏感性分析,以测试它们的个体和交互效应。我们发现,模型中的共识形成主要由以下因素决定:(1)观点更新过程中的随机性程度;(2)删除旧链接和创建新链接的相对容易程度。我们的结果展示了观点和价值观如何共同演化。此外,它们可能有助于理解人们对新政策的反应,如与新冠相关的限制或呼吁转向更多植物性饮食。


# Decomposing Variance Decomposition for Stochastic Models: Application to a Proof-Of-Concept Human Migration Agent-Based Model

随机模型的方差分解分解:应用于概念验证的人口迁移主体模型


## Takeaways
1. 技术类

## Abstract

Agent-based models (ABMs) are promising tools for improving our understanding of complex natural-human systems and supporting decision-making processes. ABM bottom-up approach is increasingly employed to recreate emergent behaviors that mimic real complex system dynamics. However, often the knowledge and data available for building and testing the ABM and its parts are scarce. Due to ABM output complexity, exhaustive analysis methods are required to increase ABM transparency and ensure that the ABM behavior mimics the real system. Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is one of the most used model analysis methods, as it identifies the most important model inputs and their interactions and can be used to explore model behaviors that occur in certain regions of the parameter space. However, due to ABM’s stochastic nature, GSA application to ABMs can result in misleading interpretations of the ABM input importance. Here, we review 3 alternative GSA approaches identified in the literature for ABMs and other stochastic models. Using two study cases, a benchmark non-linear function and a proof-of-concept migration ABM, we illustrate the differences in input importance and the shortcomings of current approaches and propose a new GSA approach for the evaluation of stochastic models which separates inputs importance for deterministic and stochastic uncertainties. The former is related to changes in the expected value of model realizations and the latter to changes in the variance of model realizations. Our analysis of the proof-of-concept migration ABM finds that how factors are weighed is more important than the values of the inputs and identifies what inputs are more important for the deterministic and stochastic uncertainties. The analysis also identifies outputs for which the deterministic uncertainty is small, being almost random. This information allows the modeler to evaluate the optimal degree of model complexity and choose among alternative model structures.

主体模型(ABMs)是改善我们对复杂自然-人类系统理解和支持决策过程的有前景的工具。ABM自下而上的方法越来越多地被用来重现模拟真实复杂系统动态的涌现行为。然而,通常用于构建和测试ABM及其部件的知识和数据是稀缺的。由于ABM输出的复杂性,需要穷尽分析方法来提高ABM的透明度,并确保ABM行为模拟真实系统。全局敏感性分析(GSA)是最常用的模型分析方法之一,因为它可以识别最重要的模型输入及其交互作用,并可用于探索参数空间某些区域中出现的模型行为。然而,由于ABM的随机性,将GSA应用于ABM可能导致对ABM输入重要性的误导性解释。在这里,我们回顾了文献中确定的针对ABM和其他随机模型的3种替代GSA方法。使用两个案例研究,一个基准非线性函数和一个概念验证的迁移ABM,我们说明了输入重要性的差异和当前方法的局限性,并提出了一种新的GSA方法用于随机模型的评估,该方法将输入对确定性和随机不确定性的重要性分开。前者与模型实现的期望值变化有关,后者与模型实现的方差变化有关。我们对概念验证迁移ABM的分析发现,因素如何加权比输入值更重要,并确定了哪些输入对确定性和随机不确定性更重要。分析还识别出确定性不确定性较小的输出,几乎是随机的。这些信息使得模型实现的方差分解得以分解。我们展示了如何使用该信息来指导对ABM的未来改进。

# A Fast Embedded Language for Continuous-Time Agent-Based Simulation

## Takeaways
1. 连续时间模型，看不懂。


## Abstract

In agent-based simulation methods and applications, discrete timestep approaches prevail. To support continuous-time agent-based simulation, we analyze how methods for simulating population-based Con-tinu-ous-Time Markov Chains (CMTCs) can be adopted and derive implications for the concrete realization. To corroborate our findings, we develop an efficient internal domain-specific language (DSL) based on ML3, a modeling language for linked lives in demography. The design as an internal DSL, implemented within the Rust programming language, allows the modeler to exploit the complete feature set of the host language, such as data types and structures, when programming decision processes. A concise and expressive modeling of an agent's discrete decisions and behavior introducing exponentially distributed sojourn times can be supported by adapting the concept of guarded commands from population-based CTMCs. The execution of models relies on an optimized version of the direct method. This method is a variant of stochastic simulation algorithms, an established method for executing population-based CTMCs in other application areas, notably biochemistry. To efficiently handle the large set of possible transitions inherent to continuous-time agent-based models, we use a dependency graph whose updating scheme caters to the dynamic dependencies within agent-based models and the need for efficient implementation. The presented case studies include implementations of a continuous-time, agent-based migration model and a comparative performance study based on an extended SIR model of infection spread, allowing us to draw conclusions about the impact of different design choices on efficiency.


在主体模拟方法和应用中,离散时间步方法占主导地位。为了支持连续时间主体模拟,我们分析了如何采用模拟基于人口的连续时间马尔可夫链(CMTCs)的方法,并推导出具体实现的启示。为了证实我们的发现,我们开发了一种基于ML3(一种用于人口统计学中关联生命建模的语言)的高效内部领域特定语言(DSL)。作为一种内部DSL,在Rust编程语言中实现,它允许建模者在编程决策过程时利用宿主语言的全部特性,如数据类型和结构。通过改编基于人口的CTMCs中的警戒命令概念,可以支持主体离散决策和行为的简洁而富有表现力的建模,引入指数分布的停留时间。模型的执行依赖于直接法的优化版本。这种方法是随机模拟算法的一个变体,是在其他应用领域(特别是生物化学)中执行基于人口的CTMCs的一种成熟方法。为了有效处理连续时间主体模型固有的大量可能转移,我们使用了一个依赖关系图,其更新方案迎合了主体模型内的动态依赖关系和高效实现的需求。所提供的案例研究包括一个连续时间、基于主体的迁移模型的实现,以及一个基于扩展SIR感染传播模型的比较性能研究,使我们能够得出关于不同设计选择对效率影响的结论。

## Abstract

For many applications of agent-based models (ABMs), an agent's age influences important decisions (e.g. their contribution to/withdrawal from pension funds, their level of risk aversion in decision-making, etc.) and outcomes in their life cycle (e.g. their susceptibility to disease). These considerations make it crucial to accurately capture the age distribution of the population being considered. **Often, empirical survival probabilities cannot be used in ABMs to generate the observed age structure.** This may be due to discrepancies between samples (e.g. when empirical survival probabilities are calculated across the whole population, but only a sub-population is being modelled) or models (between the survival model underpinning the ABM and the statistical model used to produce empirical survival probabilities). In these cases, **imputing empirical survival probabilities will not generate the observed age structure of the population, and assumptions such as exogenous agent inflows are required (but not necessarily empirically valid)**. In this paper, we propose a method that allows for the preservation of agent age-structure without the exogenous influx of agents, even when only a subset of the population is being modelled. We demonstrate the flexibility and accuracy of our methodology by performing simulations of several real-world age distributions. This method is a useful tool for those developing ABMs across a broad range of applications.

在主体模型(ABMs)的许多应用中,主体的年龄会影响其生命周期中的重要决策(例如,他们对养老基金的贡献/提取,他们在决策中的风险厌恶程度等)和结果(例如,他们对疾病的易感性)。这些考虑使得准确捕捉所研究人群的年龄分布至关重要。通常,经验生存概率不能直接用于ABMs以生成观察到的年龄结构。这可能是由于样本之间的差异(例如,当经验生存概率是在整个人口中计算的,但只对一个子群体进行建模时)或模型之间的差异(在支撑ABM的生存模型和用于产生经验生存概率的统计模型之间)。在这些情况下,直接输入经验生存概率将无法生成观察到的人口年龄结构,需要假设外生的主体流入(但不一定具有经验验证性)。在本文中,我们提出了一种方法,即使只对人口的一个子集进行建模,也能在没有外生主体流入的情况下保持主体年龄结构。我们通过对几个真实世界的年龄分布进行模拟,证明了我们方法的灵活性和准确性。该方法是一个有用的工具,适用于在广泛的应用中开发ABMs的研究者。

# Talk Less to Strangers: How Homophily Can Improve Collective Decision-Making in Diverse Teams
少与陌生人交谈:同质性如何提高多元化团队的集体决策

## Takeaways

1. 研究问题：身份同质性 (homophily) 如何影响集体决策
2. ‘hidden profile’ setting：关键信息分散在不同成员手中,需要通过讨论整合信息
3. 研究结论：同质性反而有利于决策质量,因为它导致了不同群体之间暂时的意见分歧，并且存在讨论时间和决策质量。

## Abstract

Identity diversity（身份多样性） in teams brings advantages for complex decision-making because it is associated with cognitive diversity（认知多样性） among team members. At the same time, homophilous interactions along shared identity dimensions can hinder information exchange among dissimilar individuals and threaten successful exploitation of the team’s cognitive diversity. We present an agent-based model to investigate how homophily impacts decision-making quality in diverse teams. Team members communicate information in a ‘hidden profile’ setting where some pieces of information are known only to single individuals while other pieces of information are known to subgroups with the same identity. While intuition may suggest that homophily impairs collective decision-making, our model reveals how homophilous environments lead to better collective decisions: homophily fosters temporary disagreements between dissimilar team members, which grant teams additional time to uncover crucial information that would not have been shared otherwise. Longer discussion time comes along with improvements in the quality of the final decision, indicating a trade-off between the time needed to deliberate and decision quality.

团队中的身份多样性为复杂决策带来优势,因为它与团队成员之间的认知多样性相关。同时,沿着共同的身份维度进行的同质性互动可能会阻碍不同个体之间的信息交流,并威胁到团队认知多样性的成功利用。我们提出了一个基于主体的模型来研究同质性如何影响多元化团队的决策质量。团队成员在一个"隐藏的概况"环境中传递信息,其中一些信息只有个别人知道,而另一些信息为具有相同身份的子群体所知。直觉可能表明同质性会损害集体决策,但我们的模型揭示了同质性环境如何导致更好的集体决策:同质性促进了不同团队成员之间的暂时分歧,这给予团队额外的时间来发现原本不会被分享的关键信息。更长的讨论时间伴随着最终决策质量的提高,表明deliberation所需时间与决策质量之间存在权衡。
