# Editorial: Modelling Values in Social, Technical, and Ecological Systems

## Abstract

This editorial paper for the special section on “Modelling Values in Socio/Technical/Ecological Systems” introduces interdisciplinary perspectives on values and reflects on growing appeals for modelling values. In public and academic discourses, values typically relate to matters of importance (e.g., beliefs, priorities) and principles about what is considered to be good (e.g., moral values) and are often seen as shaping individual and collective behaviour. As shown by eight contributions to this special section, it is relevant for social simulation modelling to dive deeper into embedding values in models in order to explore behavioural change on different levels and across contexts. Our goal with this special section is to stimulate interest in developing various approaches that study and operationalise values in agent-based models to investigate the complex problems raised in social, socio-technical and socio-ecological systems. We conclude with a call for future research to be explicit in their modelling assumptions, thus fostering a vigorous foundation for scientific discourse.

# Methods That Support the Validation of Agent-Based Models: An Overview and Discussion

## Abstract

Validation is the process of determining if a model adequately represents the system under study for the model’s intended purpose. Validation is a critical component in building the credibility of a simulation model with its end-users. Effectively conducting validation can be a daunting task for both novice and experienced simulation developers. Further compounding the difficult task of conducting validation is that there is no universally accepted approach for assessing a simulation. These challenges are particularly relevant to the paradigm of Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) because of the complexity found in these models’ mechanisms and in the real-world situations they attempt to represent. To aid both the novice and expert in conducting a validation process for an agent-based simulation, this article reviews nine methods that are useful for this process, including foundational topics of docking, empirical validation, sampling, and visualization, as well as advanced topics of bootstrapping, causal analysis, inverse generative social science, and role-playing. Each method is reviewed with respect to its benefits and limitations as a validation-supporting method for ABMS. Suggestions that may support a validation plan for an agent-based simulations, are also provided. This article is an introductory guide for understanding and conducting ABMS validation for developers of all experience levels.


验证是确定模型是否充分表示研究系统以满足模型预期目的的过程。验证是建立模拟模型对最终用户可信度的关键组成部分。无论是新手还是有经验的模拟开发人员,有效地进行验证都可能是一项艰巨的任务。进一步加剧验证任务难度的是,没有普遍接受的评估模拟的方法。这些挑战与主体建模和模拟(ABMS)范式尤其相关,因为这些模型的机制以及它们试图表示的现实世界情况都具有复杂性。为了帮助新手和专家为主体模拟进行验证过程,本文回顾了九种对该过程有用的方法,包括基础主题如对接、经验验证、抽样和可视化,以及高级主题如自助法、因果分析、反向生成社会科学和角色扮演。每种方法都根据其作为ABMS验证支持方法的优点和局限性进行了回顾。本文还提供了可能支持主体模拟验证计划的建议。本文是一份针对各种经验水平的开发人员理解和进行ABMS验证的入门指南。





# An Exploration of Drivers of Opinion Dynamics
探索观点动态的驱动因素

## Abstract
Our ability to deal with external changes is determined by our collective willingness to transform and adopt new technologies. These factors are driven by people's opinion on the change itself and the proposed policies. Humans constantly update their opinion by integrating new information they hear with their values, which helps them make a judgement about that new information. Here, we create an agent-based model that explicitly incorporates the concept of values to explore possible drivers of opinion dynamics. In the model, we explore several factors and perform local and global sensitivity analysis to test their individual and interaction effects. We find that consensus formation in the model is mainly determined by factors related to (1) the amount of stochasticity in the opinion updating procedure and (2) the relative ease with which old links are removed and new links are created. Our results demonstrate how opinions and values may co-evolve. Furthermore, they may help in understanding human responses to new policies such as covid-related restrictions or calls to shift to a more plant-based diet.

我们应对外部变化的能力取决于我们集体转型和采用新技术的意愿。这些因素受到人们对变革本身和提出的政策的看法的驱动。人们通过将他们听到的新信息与自己的价值观相结合来不断更新自己的观点,这有助于他们对新信息做出判断。在这里,我们创建了一个显式地结合价值观概念的主体模型,以探索观点动态的可能驱动因素。在模型中,我们探索了几个因素,并进行了局部和全局敏感性分析,以测试它们的个体和交互效应。我们发现,模型中的共识形成主要由以下因素决定:(1)观点更新过程中的随机性程度;(2)删除旧链接和创建新链接的相对容易程度。我们的结果展示了观点和价值观如何共同演化。此外,它们可能有助于理解人们对新政策的反应,如与新冠相关的限制或呼吁转向更多植物性饮食。


# Decomposing Variance Decomposition for Stochastic Models: Application to a Proof-Of-Concept Human Migration Agent-Based Model

## Abstract

Agent-based models (ABMs) are promising tools for improving our understanding of complex natural-human systems and supporting decision-making processes. ABM bottom-up approach is increasingly employed to recreate emergent behaviors that mimic real complex system dynamics. However, often the knowledge and data available for building and testing the ABM and its parts are scarce. Due to ABM output complexity, exhaustive analysis methods are required to increase ABM transparency and ensure that the ABM behavior mimics the real system. Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is one of the most used model analysis methods, as it identifies the most important model inputs and their interactions and can be used to explore model behaviors that occur in certain regions of the parameter space. However, due to ABM’s stochastic nature, GSA application to ABMs can result in misleading interpretations of the ABM input importance. Here, we review 3 alternative GSA approaches identified in the literature for ABMs and other stochastic models. Using two study cases, a benchmark non-linear function and a proof-of-concept migration ABM, we illustrate the differences in input importance and the shortcomings of current approaches and propose a new GSA approach for the evaluation of stochastic models which separates inputs importance for deterministic and stochastic uncertainties. The former is related to changes in the expected value of model realizations and the latter to changes in the variance of model realizations. Our analysis of the proof-of-concept migration ABM finds that how factors are weighed is more important than the values of the inputs and identifies what inputs are more important for the deterministic and stochastic uncertainties. The analysis also identifies outputs for which the deterministic uncertainty is small, being almost random. This information allows the modeler to evaluate the optimal degree of model complexity and choose among alternative model structures.

主体模型(ABMs)是改善我们对复杂自然-人类系统理解和支持决策过程的有前景的工具。ABM自下而上的方法越来越多地被用来重现模拟真实复杂系统动态的涌现行为。然而,通常用于构建和测试ABM及其部件的知识和数据是稀缺的。由于ABM输出的复杂性,需要穷尽分析方法来提高ABM的透明度,并确保ABM行为模拟真实系统。全局敏感性分析(GSA)是最常用的模型分析方法之一,因为它可以识别最重要的模型输入及其交互作用,并可用于探索参数空间某些区域中出现的模型行为。然而,由于ABM的随机性,将GSA应用于ABM可能导致对ABM输入重要性的误导性解释。在这里,我们回顾了文献中确定的针对ABM和其他随机模型的3种替代GSA方法。使用两个案例研究,一个基准非线性函数和一个概念验证的迁移ABM,我们说明了输入重要性的差异和当前方法的局限性,并提出了一种新的GSA方法用于随机模型的评估,该方法将输入对确定性和随机不确定性的重要性分开。前者与模型实现的期望值变化有关,后者与模型实现的方差变化有关。我们对概念验证迁移ABM的分析发现,因素如何加权比输入值更重要,并确定了哪些输入对确定性和随机不确定性更重要。分析还识别出确定性不确定性较小的输出,几乎是随机的。这些信息使得模型实现的方差分解得以分解。我们展示了如何使用该信息来指导对ABM的未来改进。

# A Fast Embedded Language for Continuous-Time Agent-Based Simulation

## Takeaways
1. 连续时间模型，看不懂。


## Abstract

In agent-based simulation methods and applications, discrete timestep approaches prevail. To support continuous-time agent-based simulation, we analyze how methods for simulating population-based Con-tinu-ous-Time Markov Chains (CMTCs) can be adopted and derive implications for the concrete realization. To corroborate our findings, we develop an efficient internal domain-specific language (DSL) based on ML3, a modeling language for linked lives in demography. The design as an internal DSL, implemented within the Rust programming language, allows the modeler to exploit the complete feature set of the host language, such as data types and structures, when programming decision processes. A concise and expressive modeling of an agent's discrete decisions and behavior introducing exponentially distributed sojourn times can be supported by adapting the concept of guarded commands from population-based CTMCs. The execution of models relies on an optimized version of the direct method. This method is a variant of stochastic simulation algorithms, an established method for executing population-based CTMCs in other application areas, notably biochemistry. To efficiently handle the large set of possible transitions inherent to continuous-time agent-based models, we use a dependency graph whose updating scheme caters to the dynamic dependencies within agent-based models and the need for efficient implementation. The presented case studies include implementations of a continuous-time, agent-based migration model and a comparative performance study based on an extended SIR model of infection spread, allowing us to draw conclusions about the impact of different design choices on efficiency.


在主体模拟方法和应用中,离散时间步方法占主导地位。为了支持连续时间主体模拟,我们分析了如何采用模拟基于人口的连续时间马尔可夫链(CMTCs)的方法,并推导出具体实现的启示。为了证实我们的发现,我们开发了一种基于ML3(一种用于人口统计学中关联生命建模的语言)的高效内部领域特定语言(DSL)。作为一种内部DSL,在Rust编程语言中实现,它允许建模者在编程决策过程时利用宿主语言的全部特性,如数据类型和结构。通过改编基于人口的CTMCs中的警戒命令概念,可以支持主体离散决策和行为的简洁而富有表现力的建模,引入指数分布的停留时间。模型的执行依赖于直接法的优化版本。这种方法是随机模拟算法的一个变体,是在其他应用领域(特别是生物化学)中执行基于人口的CTMCs的一种成熟方法。为了有效处理连续时间主体模型固有的大量可能转移,我们使用了一个依赖关系图,其更新方案迎合了主体模型内的动态依赖关系和高效实现的需求。所提供的案例研究包括一个连续时间、基于主体的迁移模型的实现,以及一个基于扩展SIR感染传播模型的比较性能研究,使我们能够得出关于不同设计选择对效率影响的结论。

## Abstract

For many applications of agent-based models (ABMs), an agent's age influences important decisions (e.g. their contribution to/withdrawal from pension funds, their level of risk aversion in decision-making, etc.) and outcomes in their life cycle (e.g. their susceptibility to disease). These considerations make it crucial to accurately capture the age distribution of the population being considered. **Often, empirical survival probabilities cannot be used in ABMs to generate the observed age structure.** This may be due to discrepancies between samples (e.g. when empirical survival probabilities are calculated across the whole population, but only a sub-population is being modelled) or models (between the survival model underpinning the ABM and the statistical model used to produce empirical survival probabilities). In these cases, **imputing empirical survival probabilities will not generate the observed age structure of the population, and assumptions such as exogenous agent inflows are required (but not necessarily empirically valid)**. In this paper, we propose a method that allows for the preservation of agent age-structure without the exogenous influx of agents, even when only a subset of the population is being modelled. We demonstrate the flexibility and accuracy of our methodology by performing simulations of several real-world age distributions. This method is a useful tool for those developing ABMs across a broad range of applications.

在主体模型(ABMs)的许多应用中,主体的年龄会影响其生命周期中的重要决策(例如,他们对养老基金的贡献/提取,他们在决策中的风险厌恶程度等)和结果(例如,他们对疾病的易感性)。这些考虑使得准确捕捉所研究人群的年龄分布至关重要。通常,经验生存概率不能直接用于ABMs以生成观察到的年龄结构。这可能是由于样本之间的差异(例如,当经验生存概率是在整个人口中计算的,但只对一个子群体进行建模时)或模型之间的差异(在支撑ABM的生存模型和用于产生经验生存概率的统计模型之间)。在这些情况下,直接输入经验生存概率将无法生成观察到的人口年龄结构,需要假设外生的主体流入(但不一定具有经验验证性)。在本文中,我们提出了一种方法,即使只对人口的一个子集进行建模,也能在没有外生主体流入的情况下保持主体年龄结构。我们通过对几个真实世界的年龄分布进行模拟,证明了我们方法的灵活性和准确性。该方法是一个有用的工具,适用于在广泛的应用中开发ABMs的研究者。

# Talk Less to Strangers: How Homophily Can Improve Collective Decision-Making in Diverse Teams
少与陌生人交谈:同质性如何提高多元化团队的集体决策

## Takeaways

1. 研究问题：身份同质性 (homophily) 如何影响集体决策
2. ‘hidden profile’ setting：关键信息分散在不同成员手中,需要通过讨论整合信息
3. 研究结论：同质性反而有利于决策质量,因为它导致了不同群体之间暂时的意见分歧，并且存在讨论时间和决策质量。

## Abstract

Identity diversity（身份多样性） in teams brings advantages for complex decision-making because it is associated with cognitive diversity（认知多样性） among team members. At the same time, homophilous interactions along shared identity dimensions can hinder information exchange among dissimilar individuals and threaten successful exploitation of the team’s cognitive diversity. We present an agent-based model to investigate how homophily impacts decision-making quality in diverse teams. Team members communicate information in a ‘hidden profile’ setting where some pieces of information are known only to single individuals while other pieces of information are known to subgroups with the same identity. While intuition may suggest that homophily impairs collective decision-making, our model reveals how homophilous environments lead to better collective decisions: homophily fosters temporary disagreements between dissimilar team members, which grant teams additional time to uncover crucial information that would not have been shared otherwise. Longer discussion time comes along with improvements in the quality of the final decision, indicating a trade-off between the time needed to deliberate and decision quality.

团队中的身份多样性为复杂决策带来优势,因为它与团队成员之间的认知多样性相关。同时,沿着共同的身份维度进行的同质性互动可能会阻碍不同个体之间的信息交流,并威胁到团队认知多样性的成功利用。我们提出了一个基于主体的模型来研究同质性如何影响多元化团队的决策质量。团队成员在一个"隐藏的概况"环境中传递信息,其中一些信息只有个别人知道,而另一些信息为具有相同身份的子群体所知。直觉可能表明同质性会损害集体决策,但我们的模型揭示了同质性环境如何导致更好的集体决策:同质性促进了不同团队成员之间的暂时分歧,这给予团队额外的时间来发现原本不会被分享的关键信息。更长的讨论时间伴随着最终决策质量的提高,表明deliberation所需时间与决策质量之间存在权衡。
